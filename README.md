## Problem Statement:
Mental health issues, particularly mood disorders such as
depression and anxiety, affect millions of people worldwide. Timely interventions can
significantly improve outcomes, yet many individuals either do not have access to mental
health professionals or are unable to recognize the warning signs of a downward mood
spiral until it is too late. The ongoing stigma around mental health also discourages
people from seeking professional help early. Furthermore, there is a lack of scalable,
proactive systems that can provide personalized, data-driven support without waiting for
users to seek assistance.
This project seeks to address:
The difficulty in tracking and predicting fluctuations in mood.
The lack of timely, proactive interventions for mental health management.
Limited access to personalized digital therapy based on individual mental health data.
The stigma associated with mental health, which prevents early intervention.
By building a system that predicts mood swings and provides users with timely,
personalized digital therapy recommendations (such as meditation or breathing
exercises), we aim to offer a proactive solution to individuals struggling with mental
health.

## üìçInnovative Solutions (Ideation):

Predictive Mood Analytics:
Use data-driven machine learning models to track user inputs (self-reported moods,
behavioral data such as sleep, activity levels, social media activity, and sensor data) to
predict future mood swings. The system can detect patterns and alert users before they
experience a downturn, enabling early interventions.
Personalized Therapy Recommendations:
The system will offer targeted, evidence-based digital therapies, such as guided
meditation, breathing exercises, or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-inspired
techniques based on the user‚Äôs predicted mood trajectory. It personalizes suggestions
based on the user's history, preferences, and feedback.
Self-reporting with Natural Language Processing (NLP):
HACKTIVISTS
Users will self-report their emotions using free text or predefined scales. NLP algorithms
can analyze the sentiment of these inputs, providing deeper insights into emotional states
and refining the accuracy of mood predictions.
Mental Health Dashboard:
A user-friendly dashboard that visualizes trends, patterns, and the correlation between
different factors (age,gender,depression,anxiety, etc.) and mental health, empowering users to make
informed decisions about their wellbeing.
Gamified Progress Tracking:
Gamification elements like achievements, daily streaks for completing exercises, or
rewards for consistently using digital therapy could enhance engagement and long-term
adherence to therapeutic interventions.
